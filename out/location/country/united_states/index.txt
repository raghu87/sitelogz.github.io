3:T587,Paleo-Indians migrated across the Bering land bridge more than 12,000
        years ago. British colonization led to the first settlement of the
        Thirteen Colonies in Virginia in 1607. Clashes with the British Crown
        over taxation and political representation sparked the American
        Revolution, with the Second Continental Congress formally declaring
        independence on July 4, 1776. Following its victory in the
        Revolutionary War (1775–1783), the country continued to expand across
        North America. As more states were admitted, sectional division over
        slavery led to the secession of the Confederate States of America,
        which fought the remaining states of the Union during the 1861–1865
        American Civil War. With the Union's victory and preservation, slavery
        was abolished nationally. By 1890, the United States had established
        itself as a great power. After Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor in
        December 1941, the U.S. entered World War II. The aftermath of the war
        left the U.S. and the Soviet Union as the world's two superpowers and
        led to the Cold War, during which both countries engaged in a struggle
        for ideological dominance and international influence. Following the
        Soviet Union's collapse and the end of the Cold War in 1991, the U.S.
        emerged as the world's sole superpower.0:["_AfZaECKNAJpOZuu0Ib-n",[[["",{"children":["location",{"children":["country",{"children":["united_states",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]}]}]}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",{"children":["location",{"children":["country",{"children":["united_states",{"children":["__PAGE__",{},[["$L1",["$","$L2",null,{"location":true,"country":true,"singleCountry":[["$","div",null,{"className":"singleCountryMain_country_outer_container__hL5rB","children":[["$","p","0",{"className":"singleCountryMain_gap_bottom_20__nHofH","children":"The United States of America (USA or U.S.A.), commonly known as the United States (US or U.S.) or America, is a country primarily located in North America.
